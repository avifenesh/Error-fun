## Code Style Guidelines

### General
- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)
- Follow language-specific naming conventions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write descriptive variable and function names

### Error Handling
- Handle errors explicitly, don't ignore them
- Use appropriate error types for the language
- Provide meaningful error messages

### Comments
- Only add comments when code intent isn't clear
- Keep comments up to date with code changes
- Prefer self-documenting code over comments

## Project Structure
- Organize files by feature/module
- Keep related files together
- Use clear directory names
