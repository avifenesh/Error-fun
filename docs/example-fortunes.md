# Error Message Fortune Cookies - Example Fortunes

This file contains example fortune templates for each style. These can be used as a starting point for creating your own fortune templates.

## Confucius Style

```
Confucius say: Man who {action} {subject} find himself {consequence}.
Ancient wisdom tell us: Those who {action} will surely {consequence}.
Path to enlightenment never {action}. Wise developer {alternative}.
In garden of code, {subject} cannot grow without {requirement}.
Confucius say: {errorType} today leads to wisdom tomorrow, but only if you {solution}.
Developer who chases two bugs catches neither. Focus on {subject} first.
Code written in anger should be refactored in calm.
Before fixing bug, first understand why it exists.
Wise programmer knows difference between running code and correct code.
Bug that appears impossible usually has simple explanation hidden in {subject}.
```

## Haiku Style

```
Silent exception
Types confused and mismatched now
Debug through the night

Code refuses work
Calling names that don't exist
Stack trace tells no lies

Functions returning
Errors hiding in plain sight
Restart and try again

Null pointer beckons
Grammar broken, parser weeps
Silence fills the screen

Variables lost
Expecting what was never there
Code begins to break
```

## Tarot Style

```
{card} appears in {position} position. {interpretation} {advice}
Your code reveals {card}, {position}. {interpretation} {advice}
The digital tarot shows {card} in {position} alignment. {interpretation} {advice}
I see {card} in your future, {position}. {interpretation} {advice}
The cards have spoken: {card} dominates your path, {position}. {interpretation} {advice}
```

## Blame Deflector Style

```
This error is clearly due to a cosmic ray flipping a bit in memory. Not your fault at all!
Mercury is in retrograde, affecting all pointer arithmetic in your timezone.
Your code is perfect. It's the laws of physics that are wrong today.
A temporal anomaly in the server room has caused your variables to time travel.
Quantum fluctuations in the CPU have created an alternate reality where this code doesn't work.
Your keyboard has been secretly autocorrecting your perfect code into errors.
The alignment of Wi-Fi waves with the office building is creating interference patterns in your logic.
The compiler is clearly in a bad mood today. Try again when it's feeling better.
Your code worked fine until someone made eye contact with the server.
The error is actually a feature if you look at it from a non-Euclidean perspective.
```

## Motivational Style

```
PERSISTENCE
It's not about avoiding errors; it's about how elegantly you handle them.

DEBUGGING
The error message is the first step on the road to a solution.

RESILIENCE
Behind every great program is a developer who refused to give up on a stubborn bug.

CREATIVITY
Errors are just the universe's way of telling you there's a more creative solution.

GROWTH
The difference between a junior and senior developer is how they react to the same error message.

PERSPECTIVE
Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.

PROGRESS
Your code doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be better than it was yesterday.

INSIGHT
The most valuable line in your program is the one that shows you where you went wrong.

SUCCESS
Success is not the absence of errors, but the presence of solutions.

JOURNEY
The path to clean code is paved with a thousand error messages.
